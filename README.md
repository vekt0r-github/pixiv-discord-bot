# pixiv-bot

a simple discord bot that responds to pixiv links with the full-size image, removing the embed from the original message

my instance of the bot is private but you can contact me if you really want to add it i guess

## perms

send messages, manage messages, read message history (75776); you should give bot the ability to view any channels it needs

## usage

run `node index.js` on the machine you want to host the bot on
